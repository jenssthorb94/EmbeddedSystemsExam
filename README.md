# EmbeddedSystemsExam
My exam in Embedded systems fall 2017. Together with an IFFT-applet and a Blynk app I can monitor the water level, humidity and temperature in my basement (or any other area where it might be interesting). The IFFT-applet sends me a message when the water level is critical, which is a value you can change in the code. In order to monitor the levels in realtime, I created a mobile app with Blynk.

To see more info about setup, code and some pictures, check out the 'Dokumentasjon.pdf' (Only in norwegian).
